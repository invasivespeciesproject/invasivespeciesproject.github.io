The [Asian Ladybeetle](http://issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=668) 
(Harmonia axyridis, or h.axyridis), known as Harlequin lady beetle and 
Halloween ladybeetle, appears very much like the ‘lady bug’ 
each of us are familiar with, except they are slightly larger. They are 
also known as the multicolored Asian lady beetle as the color varies in 
the red-orange to yellow-orange with no spots to about 20.

The Asian Ladybeetle is interesting as an invasive species because they are 
both pest to some agriculture and benefit to others. 

As a beneficial insect, they act to [control pest aphid populations](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/foresthealth/ladybeetle.html), mites 
and scale insects infestingpine trees, ornamental shrubs, roses, [pecan, 
crape myrtle](http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/75692/73350), 
and other plants. But as a pest for example, it consumes wine grapes. 
Plus they release hemolymph (an invertebrate fluid equivalent to blood) 
when they are disturbed or killed. This fluid has an unpleasant odor and 
taste, which spoils wine production if harvested with the grapes. The 
Asian Ladybeetle is also considered a [pest](http://issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=668) to the apple, pear, raspberry, 
citrus, and potato agriculture industry. As a nuisance pest, when temperatures 
begin to drop the Asian Ladybeetle swarms search for [warm places](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/us/asian-cousin-of-ladybug-is-a-most-unwelcome-guest.html?_r=0) 
for the winter, and during the summer they have a knack for ending up in food and drink.

The National Institute of Health identifies that the [economic impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524671/) 
of the Asian Ladybeetle has yet to be quantified.

There are several [insecticides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524671/table/i1536-2442-003-32-0001-t01/) 
used to manage the Asian Ladybeetle population. Proper management however takes in consideration of the crop they are 
infesting. But for at home, sealing or spraying carefully around windows, vents, cracks, and other openings to the 
house reduce home invasion problems. A few [parasitoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524671/) 
(parasite organisms) and a fungus are known to attack the Asian Ladybeetle, but no research has been undertaken 
to investigate biological controls against these pests.
