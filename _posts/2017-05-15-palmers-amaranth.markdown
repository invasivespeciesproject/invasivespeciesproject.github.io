The [Palmer’s amaranth](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=AMPA) (Amaranthus palmeri) has 
many names - carelessweed, dioecious amaranth, and Palmer's pigweed. This invasive plant isn’t all 
that far removed from its [native territory](https://gobotany.newenglandwild.org/species/amaranthus/palmeri/) 
of southwest United States (California, New Mexico, and Texas) and Mexico. Parts [(leaves, stems, and seeds)](http://www.pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amaranthus+palmeri) 
of this plant are [edible](http://naeb.brit.org/uses/search/?string=Amaranthus+palmeri) 
by human, and they are considered a healthy, nutritious staple as long as one doesn’t have kidney issues with 
[oxylates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17511467). Although the roots of the plant are known to have 
“excessive” concentrations of nitrates which is [toxic](http://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/php/plants.php?action=indiv&byname=scientific&keynum=12) 
to animals and humans.  

While the plant is considered native to the southwestern US, it has spread through much of the [US farmlands](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=AMPA) 
as far as Wisconsin, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts), and is considered more of a 
nuisance weed than an edible herbaceous flowering plant, as the plant out competes other crops since 
it is fast growing. Plus, it has become resistant to [herbicide glyphosate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824275/), 
such as found in RoundUp or Monsanto, as well as other [herbicides](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23358302.pdf), 
making controlling against it difficult in crops. The spread is attributed to human activity [transporting seeds](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23358302.pdf).

The amount of interference p.amaranth inflicts on a crop may vary for conditions or type of crop as it 
competes with the other plants. It also interferes with harvest as it gets harvested in the bulkof the 
other crop. In a [review article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23358302) of the plant published for 
Weed Science Society of America, crops like corn, cotton, peanut, sorghum, soybean and sweet potato 
suffered yield loss from as little as 7% to 11% to as much as 91% to 94%.

It has been noted already that chemical control methods against this invasive plant are hindered by 
the plant becoming resistant to various herbicides. Physical methods are more effective, albeitmore 
difficult to implement. Cutting the stalk 3cm from the ground to ground level produced a 64% to 95% 
[mortality rate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aab.12129/abstract) in the plant, and 
such activity of cutting reduces the viability of the plant to reach maturity to produce seeds.
