Scientific name: *Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire*
Common Name: Emerald Ash Borer
Native to: Asia
Range: Eastern US

Behavior/ Life Cycle: The emerald ash borer emerges May - July and the females lay eggs between layers of bark.  The eggs hatch and the larvae cut through the tree creating gaps which, cuts off the flow of water and nutrients in the tree, causing the treeâ€™s death. 

How did it get to the US?
- emerald ash borer was transported to the United States hiding in wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia.
Economic impact:.
- Killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America.
- Threatens to severely reduce or eliminate the ash lumber industry of U.S., worth an estimated value of $25.1 billion per year
- Responses to the infestation include treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 17 million ash trees at an estimated cost of $10.7 billion.
Control:
- Citizens encouraged not to move firewood to stop the spread of the insect
- Research is being conducted to find effective chemical and biological control methods, but, it is unlikely that Borer can be completely dealt with due to the quickness of their reproduction and sheer number of them in the US already
