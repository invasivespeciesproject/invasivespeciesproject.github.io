Megacopta cribraria, most commonly known as "The Kudzu Bug," is an invasive species originating in China and India. 
They are, like the [Brown Marmorated Stink Bug](https://invasivespeciesproject.github.io/invasive_species/2017/05/12/brown-marmorated-stink-bug.html), 
a [species of stink bug](https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/444/444-356/444-356_pdf.pdf). So as a stink bug, killing it will result in a foul smell. 
However, [Telling them apart](https://www.kudzubug.org/identification/) from other species of stink bug is simple. They are anywhere from 3.5mm to 6mm and sport a globular 
olive-green colored shield.

First sightings of the Kudzu Bug were recorded in 2009 in northern Georgia. Since then, it has begun to spread outward, spreading to the surrounding states and most recently 
reaching parts of Maryland, Florida and Louisiana.

The Kudzu Bug is a problem because they are an agricultural pest. In the spring, the bug will infest a host plant where after growing, their offspring will feed for the rest of the year. 
The plants the Kudzu Bug uses to breed experience reduced growth rate and crop yield. The bug's preferred host plant tends to be [legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume). Well-known 
types of legumes are peas, lentils, soybeans and peanuts. However, the Kudzu bug has the upside of being beneficial to forests as it can slow the growth of its primary host plant, the Kudzu 
Vine. The Kudzu Vine reportedly experiences a [33% reduction](https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-lookup/doi/10.1603/EN11231) in growth rate when used as a host plant. So the termination of 
this bug would be a blessing and a curse to farmers in the U.S. where the Kudzu Vine is estimated to cost $100 - $500 million per year.

Another problem Kudzu bugs present is that they, like the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug, infest houses during the winter. Their bodily secretions can also irritate human skin, resulting in a [rash](https://images.bugwood.org/images/768x512/5455584.jpg). 
So they aren't just a nuisance to farmers. On a larger scale, controlling the Kudzu Bug population means destroying Kudzu patches. In homes, the most reliable thing to do is to bugproof 
the outside of the home to prevent entry and when they are able to get inside, do not crush them. Keep a vaccuum cleaner close by, or simply trap them.
